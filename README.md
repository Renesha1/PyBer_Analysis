## Business Recommendations
1. There should be more marketing tactics of the PyBer company to rural and suburban areas by looking at factors that play a role in accruing money for each specific city type. Target the groups of people that's more than likely to use the company and that would be the areas to use for marketing methods.
2. Find a way to keep Urban areas at a rise instead of fluctuating so much.
3. It's worth taking a deeper look into the fare cost per driver in rural and surburban city types. 
   If fares are reduced or incentives are available more people will be able to afford the PyBer services therefore more people will use the company in those areas       sequentially making more money because it will appeal to more people.
